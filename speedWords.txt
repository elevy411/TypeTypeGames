I
took
my
baby
now
I
believe
in
miracles
and
a
miracles
has
happened
tonight
I
talk
about
equality
but
in
truth
you
are
either
wrong
or
you're
right
I
ain't
scared
of
your
brother
protection
for
gangs
across
the
nations
now
its
not
about
races
not
going
to
spend
my
life
being
a
color
kicking
dirt
in
my
eye
