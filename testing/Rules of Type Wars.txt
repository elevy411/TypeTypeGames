How game works:
2 players
Player 1 starts the game off by typing a list of words
Timer is set based on difficulty
The number of words typed is calculated for the player

Player 2 types the same list that player 1 typed
Timer is set based on difficulty
The number of words typed is calculated for the player

Either player 1 or player 2's health is modified after each round
Whoever typed the least amount of words gets a decrement in health
If health of either player reaches zero, game is over and other player wins

This continues for rounds until some player reaches zero in health
